//Installation docs
https1://docs.docker.com/installation/

//Install Docker

wget -qO- https://get.docker.com/ | sh

//Add user to docker group to avoid having to use 'sudo' before every command
sudo usermod -aG docker rajiv
//logout after this and log back in 

//Get version of docker
docker version

//Get list of all the images on the local images
docker images

//Calling a container --- syntax
//docker run name:tag echo "some text to output"
//docker run ubuntu:14.04 px ax
docker run ubuntu:14.04 echo "hello world"

//Run a container and get terminal access in that container
//syntax 
//docker run -i -t containername:tag /bin/bash
//-i is for standard input of bash and -t is for terminal
docker run -i -t ubuntu:14.04 /bin/bash
//Once inside the container, you can run any terminal command.
//For example,'ls' gives you the filesystem of the container

//We can exit the container by without stopping it (by default it stops as soon as you exit it) by ---> CTRL+P+Q

//List all running containers 
docker ps (currently running)
docker ps -a (all ever run)

//Run docker in background/deattached mode docker run -d dockerName:tag 

docker run -d centos:7 ping 127.0.0.1 -c 100

//Read docker logs 
//docker logs containerShortID

//Run a web application container (Tomcat)
docker run -d -P tomcat:7	//'P' is for port-mapping

//Find own Linux server's IP
/sbin/ifconfig

//Shut-down all docker containers
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)

//Deleting containers
docker rm docername/dockerid

//Can delete only stopped containers
docker stop 

//Delete images
docker rmi [image id]
docker rmi [repo:tag]
//If an image is tagged multiple times, remove each tag


//Rename a local image repo before pushing it to Docker Hub Repo
//Local image's repo name and reponame at docker should be same

//Must be logged in to dockerhub to successfully push
//To log-ig

docker login
